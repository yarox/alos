\subsection{Final Conclusions}

Several algorithms has been implemented and tested. We observe that we can identify main parameters like $\rho$ in order to enhance exploration or enhance exploitation. Also, several approachs have been studied in a real problem trough a labeled graph map.

We provide our source code\footnote{https://github.com/yarox/alos} in order to allow researchs and students check our results and experiment with this algorithms.
