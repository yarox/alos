     abstract = {A method is proposed in which a statistic, Θ, is used as a probabilistic measure of strength of association in the multivariate prediction of a nominal scale by nominal and/or ordinal scales. The relationship of theta to the bivariate Goodman and Kruskal's Lambda statistic is given. An algorithm using the theta statistic as criterion in an exhaustive search and optimal stepwise binary split procedure is described. A computer program and sample results are discussed.},

abstract={An iterative algorithm that finds a locally optimal partition for an arbitrary loss function, in time linear in N for each iteration is presented. The algorithm is a K-means-like clustering algorithm that uses as its distance measure a generalization of Kullback's information divergence. Moreover, it is proven that the globally optimal partition must satisfy a nearest neighbour condition using divergence as the distance measure. These results generalize similar results of L. Breiman et al. (1984) to an arbitrary number of classes or regression variables and to an arbitrary number of bills. Experimental results on a text-to-speech example are provided and additional applications of the algorithm, including the design of variable combinations, surrogate splits, composite nodes, and decision graphs, are suggested},
