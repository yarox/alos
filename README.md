# alos
Some experiments exploring ant-like optimization systems.

# Experiments
## Deterministic Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Collective Algorithms

## Ant System
The objective of this experiment is to solve a simple maze, comparing the quality of the solutions depending on the number of agents involved and the evaporation rate.

## Ensemble Algorithms
